**Bridget**, the communication link between your website & webviews. Tailored to offer an out-of-the-box solution that turns your
website's hyperlinks into actions that the Forward Publishing Mobile App uses to enable native navigation. As well as allowing a two way communication between the mobile API & the web API, giving you access to a rich feature set to mobile native functionality.


# Why a bridge?
 If a client from our Forward Publishing suite requires a mobile app, we offer a native solution to their publishing platform, i.e their web delivery. 
 
 Although it mirrors the web delivery 1:1 in terms of content and displays it in a mobile friendly webview, some functionality needs to be communicated from the web world to the mobile native world. Linking or navigation in the web does not behave the same way as it does in the mobile app, simply changing a URL in a webview will not do, it destroys the native immersion and the context of what's happening within the app is lost. 

 That's where Bridget comes in; we can think of it as a thin communicational layer between the web delivery and the mobile app, where functionality in the app is being invoked by message passing (think of Android intents) from the bridge, and vice versa.
